Name:

   Raspberry Pi Mini Distribution

About:

   A basic GNU/Linux distribution for the Raspberry Pi

Main features:

   * Arm 1176zjf-s optimized
   * Glibc based toolchain
   * Systemd init system
   * GNU/Linux system utilities (no busybox)
   * Ethernet network support
   * OpenSSH client/server

Main builds:

   fs          - Filesystem
   linux       - Linux kernel
   bootloader  - Bootloader binaries, and configs

Quick build guide:

   git submodule update --init

   buildgear build fs
   buildgear build bootloader

Quick firmware installation guide:

   1. Create an SD card with two partitions. E.g. using fdisk:
      sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

   2. Then enter the following commands in fdisk:
      n,p,enter,enter,+100M    # first partition
      a                        # select first partition as bootable
      n,p,enter,enter,w        # second partition

   3. Format the two partitions:
      sudo mkfs.vfat -n boot   /dev/mmcblk0p0
      sudo mkfs.ext4 -L rootfs /dev/mmcblk0p1

   4. Copy the kernel and bootloader to the first partition

   5. Untar the fs.tar.gz to the second partition

Build system requirements:

   Tested on Ubuntu 12.10 Minimal (64-bit x86) with the following additional
   packages installed:

   $ sudo apt-get install unzip gawk bison flex gperf texinfo libtool g++ \
                          libncurses5-dev libexpat1-dev gettext libglib2.0-dev \
                          xsltproc libxml2-utils docbook-xml intltool groff 

   Also requires reconfiguring "/bin/sh" to use bash:

   $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

   Fact: many software distributions fail to build using the dash shell.

Known issues:

   None

Filesystem layout:

   /usr/bin/            User binaries
   /usr/sbin/           System binaries (daemons, system utilities, etc.)
   /usr/lib/            Libraries
   /usr/lib/<prog>/     Program specific libraries (plug-ins, addons, etc.)
   /usr/include/        Header files
   /usr/share/man/      Man pages
   /usr/share/<prog>/   Program data files shared across all architectures
   /usr/etc/<prog>/     Configuration files for user programs
   /etc/                Configuration files for system programs

   The filesystem directory hierachy is arranged according to the FHS 2.3
   standard with the exceptions that /bin and /sbin are unused. Instead all
   software make use of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. For backwards compatibility
   /bin and /sbin remain links to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin respectively.
